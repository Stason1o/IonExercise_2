Classes, Interfaces, Arrays


Task 1:
1)	Create an ENUM called status with the following fields: New, Waiting approval, In progress, Complete. +

2)	Create a class called Country with the following fields: Name and TaxFee. +

3)	Create an abstract class called Product with some basic fields like: price, country to deliver, count, weight, delivery price and a field regarding the status of the delivery based on the ENUM created on step 1.

4)	Create an array that will contain Supported and Unsupported countries. This should be in a different class called CountrySupport. You can initialize countries in the constructor. 

5)	Create a class that will contain black list of users. Similar to step 4.

6)	Create an interface called ProductionProduct.
The interface will have 1 method called printInfo()

7)	Add 3 classes implementing the interface and extend the abstract calss Toys, Food and Furniture.
Make sure to set all the getters and setters in the abstract class and save time not doing it in the classes.

Implement the method for all the classes.

8)	Initialize some objects and print info about the objects.
Information should contain if the product is supported or not.

9)	Please focus on the readability of the code and think as you are a part of eBay or PayPall team ÔÅä this might help.
Task 2:
1)	Write a program that will create a field of 3x3 and fill it with numbers from 1 to 9 randomly. Numbers should not repeat.

2)	List the result in console so the output will look like an array
Example: 
5 8 1
2 3 9
6 7 4

3)	Make sure you can adjust the size of the array easy and the limit of numbers too.
Now the size is 3x3 and the max number is 9

Adjust the array to 2x4 (max number 8) and 5x10 (max number 50)
